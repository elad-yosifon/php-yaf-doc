/**
 * <p><b>\Yaf\Router</b> is the standard framework router. Routing is the process of taking a URI endpoint (that part of the URI which comes after the base URI: see \Yaf\Request_Abstract::setBaseUri()) and decomposing it into parameters to determine which module, controller, and action of that controller should receive the request. This values of the module, controller, action and other parameters are packaged into a \Yaf\Request_Abstract object which is then processed by \Yaf\Dispatcher. Routing occurs only once: when the request is initially received and before the first controller is dispatched. \Yaf\Router is designed to allow for mod_rewrite-like functionality using pure PHP structures. It is very loosely based on Ruby on Rails routing and does not require any prior knowledge of webserver URL rewriting</p>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Default Route</b>
 * <br/>
 * <p><b>\Yaf\Router</b> comes pre-configured with a default route \Yaf\Route_Static, which will match URIs in the shape of controller/action. Additionally, a module name may be specified as the first path element, allowing URIs of the form module/controller/action. Finally, it will also match any additional parameters appended to the URI by default - controller/action/var1/value1/var2/value2.</p>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Note:</b>
 * <p>Module name must be defined in config, considering application.module="Index,Foo,Bar", in this case, only index, foo and bar can be considered as a module name. if doesn't config, there is only one module named "Index".</p>
 * <br/>
